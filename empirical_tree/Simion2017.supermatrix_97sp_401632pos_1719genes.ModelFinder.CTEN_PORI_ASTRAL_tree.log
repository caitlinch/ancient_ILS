================== ASTRAL ===================== 

This is ASTRAL version 5.6.9
Gene trees are treated as unrooted
1719 trees read from /home/u5348329/ancient_ILS/output/tree_estimation/Simion2017.supermatrix_97sp_401632pos_1719genes.ModelFinder.gene_trees.fixed_names.treefile
All output trees will be *arbitrarily* rooted at Acanthoeca_sp
1 constraint tree read from /home/u5348329/ancient_ILS/output/constraint_trees/Simion2017.supermatrix_97sp_401632pos_1719genes.constraint_tree_3.nex
All gene trees are converted to be compatible with species tree.
