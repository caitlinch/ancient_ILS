================== ASTRAL ===================== 

This is ASTRAL version 5.6.9
Gene trees are treated as unrooted
117 trees read from /mnt/data/dayhoff/home/u5348329/ancient_ILS/02_empirical_tree_estimation/Whelan2017_gene_trees.treefile
All output trees will be *arbitrarily* rooted at Bolocera_tuediae
1 constraint tree read from /mnt/data/dayhoff/home/u5348329/ancient_ILS/02_empirical_hypothesis_trees/Whelan2017_constraint_tree_3_CtenPori.nex
All gene trees are converted to be compatible with species tree.
